# Phishing Detection System

## Overview
This project aims to detect phishing websites by analyzing their features using machine learning techniques. The system uses a variety of website attributes, such as URL structure, page content, and HTML elements, to classify websites as either phishing or legitimate.

## Features
- URL-based feature extraction.
- Classification of websites into phishing or legitimate categories.
- Machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, etc.) trained on labeled dataset.
- Web-based interface for user interaction (optional).

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model training and evaluation.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numpy**: For handling arrays and matrices.
- **Flask (Optional)**: Web framework to deploy the model in a web-based application.
- **HTML/CSS (Optional)**: Frontend for user interaction.
